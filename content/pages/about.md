As **Senior Mobile Test Automation Engineer** at [Grover Group GmbH](https://www.grover.com/de-en), I develop strategies, frameworks, tools & processes to improve the testing of mobile apps.

In the past I have also developed QA & Test Automation solutions for **Web**, **Desktop**, **Backend API**s & **Performance** tests for companies accross the US, Hong Kong & Germany.

_Although **Javascript** is my goto language for automation with tools like **Cucumber**, **Jest**, **Selenium**, **WebdriverIO**, **Cypress** & **Appium** I also have experience with **Python** & C# for UI automation with Docker for headless testing. For Peformance Testing **Tsung** & **K6** are my favorite followed by **Jmeter**._
