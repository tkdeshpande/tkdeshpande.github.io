Server-side Rendering</h1><p>We recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</p>
<p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing pages</li>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>E-commerce product listings</li>
<li>Help and documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>You should ask yourself: &quot;Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user&#x27;s request?&quot; If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user&#x27;s request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>
<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":" \nWe recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n \nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n \n- Marketing pages\n- Blog posts\n- E-commerce product listings\n- Help and documentation\n \nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n \nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request.
