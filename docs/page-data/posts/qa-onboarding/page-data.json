For an e-commerce product you as QA Manager would expect the QA to focus on the product‚Äôs checkout flow however a Tester with a background in mobile application testing might end up focusing on the navigations.\nSo at the end when you as Manager ask if the QA has understood the ‚Äúapplication‚Äù, although the answer would be yes, it would still mean different things for both of you.</em></li>\n<li>Sometimes limitations/known issues in the applications can confuse the QA/Tester thereby limiting their confidence in the application &#x26; further limit their ability to question things since they would not be sure if something is broken or an <strong><em>undocumented feature</em></strong> üòâ</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> share tons of documentation to understand details. <strong>WHY?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>As humans we can neither retain nor retrieve a lot of information in a short span of a few days. This will add enormous pressure on the new joiner while still resulting in inefficiencies at the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Everyone hates it.</strong> So just dont do it.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> ask them to execute all the cases from the entire regression suite. <strong>WHY?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>In effect, it will take forever to finish for a person with no prior knowledge of the product or processes.</li>\n<li>Too much work pressure. Not needed right when someone joins. Have mercy!</li>\n<li>Any occurrences of bugs will complicate and prolong the test.</li>\n<li>Without prior experience with the application, the end result of the test will be less than satisfactory for both the manager and the individual.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> make them work in isolation from other teams.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No matter how fast you need to get up and running with your work, they will always need to interact with people from other departments for gaining valuable knowledge. So make sure to introduce them to key people from other departments and enable them to collaborate.</li>\n<li>Also introduce each person effectively and not just names and designations. <strong>Pro tip: You need these people to remember each other.</strong></li>\n<li>Sometimes companies assign a person from the team to handle introductions. However, in non-colocated teams, not many people know each other well and hence may not have the reach or the resources or rapport to make the introductions.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"additionally-for-automation-engineers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additionally-for-automation-engineers\" aria-label=\"additionally for automation engineers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additionally for Automation Engineers</h3>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> share a bunch of test cases to automate right away. <strong>WHY?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Most often manual test cases are written from the perspective of a human, specifically a QA professional, and often need to be rewritten to make them work with automation.</li>\n<li>However without prior experience of the applications and their processes it is very challenging to adapt test cases for automation.</li>\n<li>Also driving test coverage without consulting the automation engineer with regards to scope &#x26; priority is like treating them as <strong>Automation Printing Machines</strong>, which they are not.
